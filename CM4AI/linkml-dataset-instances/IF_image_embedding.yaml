  Immunoflorescence (IF) image embeddings for each protein in the study, as
  computed by Densenet prediction. IF embeddings are paired per protein, e.g.
    IF_1,HLA-DPA1,0.022881096228957176,-0.060293108224868774, ... and
    IF_2,HLA-DPA1,0.022881096228957176,-0.11374042928218842, ... etc.,
  while APMS embeddings are for a single protein.
