  Calibration file created by the author, relating benchmark cellular
  compartment diameters in nm to computed number of distinct protein
  subunits in the compartment, according to GO. The benchmark compartments
  in this figure https://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/music/ are: cell, nucleolus,
  synapse, lysosome, centrosome, centriole, nuclear pore complex, large
  ribosomal subunit, proteasome,  dynein complex. Sizes are stated but not
  referenced. The file is used by calibrate_pairwise_distance.py to compute
  “standard protein proximities” of any two proteins given the number of
  distinct proteins in the smallest fewest distinct proteins cellular
  compartment shown in GO.
