description: >- # multi-line content
  Protein-protein proximity labels for each protein pair generated by applying
  the formula log10(D) = 1.05 * log10(C) - 0.14 to the number of distinct
  proteins of the smallest Gene Ontology component shared by the gene pair,
  from a precomputed matrix derived from GO.

  geneA, geneB, C, D, log10D, P where
  geneA := human gene name corresponding to a protein,
  geneB := human gene name corresponding to a protein,
  C :=  # of proteins in smallest GO cellular component to which both are annotated,
  D := protein-protein distance calibrated from GO see calibration file,
  log10D := log10D, and
  P := protein-protein proximity = -log10D
