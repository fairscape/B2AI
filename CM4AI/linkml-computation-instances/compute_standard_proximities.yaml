description: >- # multi-line content
  Calculate standard proximities for protein pairs based on number of discrete
  proteins in smallest GO cellular compartment (=C) and formula derived from
  regression on a “gold-standard” association of ten compartment diameters (=D)
  with C. See (https://github.com/idekerlab/MuSIC/blob/master/Figures/GitHub_calibration.png)
  for the calibration function. Compartment diameters input from calibration
  file (calibration.txt).
  This is STEP 1 in the Step By Step Guide (https://github.com/idekerlab/MuSIC/wiki/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-to-Building-a-MuSIC-Map)
usedSoftware:
  - calibrate_pariwise_distance.py (https://github.com/idekerlab/MuSIC/blob/master/calibrate_pairwise_distance.py)
usedDataset:
  - calibrated protein-protein proximity training labels (https://github.com/idekerlab/MuSIC/blob/master/data/calibration.txt)
generated:
  - calibrated protein-protein proximity training labels (test.calibrated_distance.csv, URL not given)
