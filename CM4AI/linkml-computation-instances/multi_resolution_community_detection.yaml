  Run CLiXO community detection at various stringencies to predict communities.
  See diagram at (https://bit.ly/3ueaBMg).
usedSoftware:
  - community detection (https://github.com/idekerlab/MuSIC/blob/master/community_detection.py )
usedDataset:
  - averages of predicted protein proximities (https://github.com/idekerlab/MuSIC/blob/master/Examples/MuSIC_predicted_proximity.txt)
generated:
  - System hierarchical relationships (/Examples/output/test.louvain.ddot)
  - Specific protein-system assignments (/Examples/output/louvain.termStats)
